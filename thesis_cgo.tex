\SetAbstractEnName{\MakeUppercase{Abstract}}%
\SetAbstractEnText{With recent advances in experimental and computational methods in structural biology, it is becoming increasingly clear that protein function is not only dependent on stable architectures, but equally so on the absence of well-ordered domains. These elements, also known as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or regions (IDRs) are protein chains that do not adopt organized three dimensional structures, but have nonetheless been shown to be highly functional. Instead, due to their flexible backbones, IDPs/IDRs are able to explore a large ensemble of conformations, resulting in an expansion of the functional repertoire of proteins. The cell is able to harness this flexibility by targeting IDRs for post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation. By altering the conformational sampling of IDRs through PTMs, disordered elements serve as a key points for functional control and signal integration. This paradigm is crucial for ensuring the proper execution of complex cellular processes that involve a large number of multi-tasking proteins that need to act in a coordinated manner. However, the physical mechanisms linking IDRs to functional output remain largely unknown. In this work, we study the role of phosphorylation in the assembly of the mitotic spindle which effects chromosome segregation during cell division. Phosphorylation at Tyrosine 11 (Y11) in the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of \tub (\gct) has been shown to control key aspects of the assembly of microtubules in the mitotic spindle and leads to a temperature sensitive growth phenotype in budding yeast. Through Molecular Dynamics computer simulations (MD) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) we show that non-phosphomimicking and phospho-mimicking states of the \gct sample disordered and collapsed conformations. However, the phosphomimicking (Tyrosine 11 to Aspartic Acid) mutant undergoes switch-like collective motions to an extended but also disordered state. We propose that this transition serves to control the binding of proteins involved in shaping microtubule dynamics. This is the first observation of switch-like behaviour in IDRs/IDPs where both states are disordered, making this a novel physical mechanism of control in with the potential to regulate cellular function.}
